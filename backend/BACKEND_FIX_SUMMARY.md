# Backend API Fix Summary üîß

## Problem Identified ‚ùå

The custom backend API at `http://hotelrbs.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com` was returning **500 Internal Server Error** because:

1. The `/hotel/add-hotel` endpoint **did not exist** in the backend
2. The `/hotelRoom/add` endpoint **did not exist** in the backend
3. The Flask backend only had application form endpoints, not hotel/room endpoints

## Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1. **Added Hotel Endpoint** (`/hotel/add-hotel`)
- Accepts hotel data via POST request
- Validates required fields: `hotel_code`, `name`, `rating`, `address`
- Stores data in `hotels.xlsx` Excel file
- Returns success/error response

### 2. **Added Room Endpoint** (`/hotelRoom/add`)
- Accepts room data via POST request
- Validates required fields: `room_id`, `hotel_code`, `booking_code`, `room_name`
- Stores data in `hotel_rooms.xlsx` Excel file
- Returns success/error response

### 3. **Created Helper Functions**
- `create_hotel_excel_file_if_not_exists()` - Creates hotels.xlsx with headers
- `save_hotel_to_excel(data)` - Saves hotel data to Excel
- `create_room_excel_file_if_not_exists()` - Creates hotel_rooms.xlsx with headers
- `save_room_to_excel(data)` - Saves room data to Excel

### 4. **Updated Dependencies**
- Added `flask-cors==4.0.0` to requirements.txt

### 5. **Created Deployment Files**
- `application.py` - Elastic Beanstalk entry point
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step deployment instructions
- `backend-deployment.zip` - Ready-to-deploy package

## Testing Results ‚úÖ

**Local Testing (Port 5001):**
```bash
# Hotel endpoint test
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/hotel/add-hotel \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"hotel_code":"TEST123","name":"Test Hotel","rating":5,"address":"Test Address",...}'

Response: {"success": true, "message": "Hotel added successfully"}

# Room endpoint test
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/hotelRoom/add \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"room_id":"ROOM001","hotel_code":"TEST123","booking_code":"BKG001",...}'

Response: {"success": true, "message": "Hotel room added successfully"}
```

Both endpoints are **working perfectly** locally! ‚úÖ

## Next Steps - DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED üöÄ

You need to deploy the updated backend to Elastic Beanstalk. Choose one of these methods:

### **Method 1: EB CLI (Fastest)**
```bash
cd /Users/utsavgautam/Downloads/Y-SoC-final--main/backend
eb deploy
```

### **Method 2: AWS Console**
1. Go to AWS Elastic Beanstalk Console
2. Select your environment: `hotelrbs`
3. Click "Upload and Deploy"
4. Upload: `/Users/utsavgautam/Downloads/Y-SoC-final--main/backend/backend-deployment.zip`
5. Click "Deploy"

### **Method 3: AWS CLI**
```bash
cd /Users/utsavgautam/Downloads/Y-SoC-final--main/backend
aws elasticbeanstalk create-application-version \
  --application-name hotelrbs \
  --version-label v2-hotel-endpoints \
  --source-bundle S3Bucket="your-bucket",S3Key="backend-deployment.zip"
  
aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment \
  --environment-name hotelrbs-env \
  --version-label v2-hotel-endpoints
```

## Verify Deployment üîç

After deployment, test the live endpoints:

```bash
# Test hotel endpoint
curl -X POST http://hotelrbs.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/hotel/add-hotel \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"hotel_code":"TEST123","name":"Test Hotel","rating":5,"address":"Test Address","city_id":"DXB","country_code":"AE","map_lat":25.2048,"map_lon":55.2708,"facilities":{"wifi":true},"images":[]}'

# Expected: {"success": true, "message": "Hotel added successfully"}

# Test room endpoint
curl -X POST http://hotelrbs.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/hotelRoom/add \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"room_id":"ROOM001","hotel_code":"TEST123","booking_code":"BKG001","room_name":"Deluxe Suite","base_price":150.0,"total_fare":200.0,"currency":"USD","is_refundable":true,"day_rates":{},"extras":{"breakfast":true}}'

# Expected: {"success": true, "message": "Hotel room added successfully"}
```

## Files Modified üìù

1. **`/Users/utsavgautam/Downloads/Y-SoC-final--main/backend/app.py`**
   - Added hotel and room configurations
   - Added helper functions for Excel storage
   - Added `/hotel/add-hotel` endpoint
   - Added `/hotelRoom/add` endpoint
   - Updated startup to create Excel files

2. **`/Users/utsavgautam/Downloads/Y-SoC-final--main/backend/requirements.txt`**
   - Added flask-cors dependency

3. **`/Users/utsavgautam/Downloads/Y-SoC-final--main/backend/application.py`** (NEW)
   - Elastic Beanstalk entry point

4. **`/Users/utsavgautam/Downloads/Y-SoC-final--main/backend/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** (NEW)
   - Complete deployment instructions

5. **`/Users/utsavgautam/Downloads/Y-SoC-final--main/backend/backend-deployment.zip`** (NEW)
   - Ready-to-deploy package

## Data Storage üíæ

After deployment, the backend will create:
- `hotels.xlsx` - Stores all hotel records
- `hotel_rooms.xlsx` - Stores all room records

Each record includes a timestamp for tracking.

## Important Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Port Change**: Local testing uses port 5001 (port 5000 was in use)
2. **Production Port**: Elastic Beanstalk will use port 5000 automatically
3. **Excel Files**: Created automatically on first request
4. **CORS**: Enabled for all origins
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error messages

## Summary

‚úÖ Backend endpoints added and tested successfully  
‚úÖ Deployment package created  
‚è≥ **ACTION REQUIRED**: Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk  
‚úÖ Frontend integration already complete (no changes needed)

Once deployed, your hotel and room storage will work end-to-end! üéâ
